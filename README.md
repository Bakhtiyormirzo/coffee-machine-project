# coffee-machine-project

Asks user the type of coffee they want, and checks for available resources. 
If there is not enough resources like water, milk, or coffee, the program 
informs the user about it. If there is, the program asks to inset the coins. 
It calculates the coins and gives change if needed. After every successful transaction, 
it updates the resources by subtracting the used water/milk/coffee and adding the money earned.
